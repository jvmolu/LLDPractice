/**
 * This module is about the Open/Closed Principle.
 * <p>
 * This module explores the Open/Closed Principle, which is one of the SOLID principles.
 * The Open/Closed Principle states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
 * This module contains the following classes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The Car class, which has methods for starting and stopping the car, changing the color and model of the car</li>
 *     <li> CarDao interface, which has a method for saving a car to the database</li>
 *     <li>CarStoreDao class, which implements the CarDao interface</li>
 *     <li> CarWarehouseDao class, which implements the CarDao interface</li>
